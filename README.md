# SweetyBread Plugin

This plugin was made **purely for fun**, inspired by a joke from a friend and the movie  
**“Green Elephant”**.

The idea came up spontaneously and was implemented **just for Java practice**.  
This project is not meant to be serious in any way.

---

## How it works

When a **composter** is filled to **100%**,  
there is a **configurable chance** that a **Sweet Bread** item will drop from it.

The drop chance can be adjusted in the plugin configuration file.

That’s all it does.


## Requirements

- **Minecraft server**: Paper / Spigot  
  - Tested on **Minecraft 1.21.x**
- **Java**: Java 17+ (recommended for modern Paper versions)
- **Build system**: Maven
