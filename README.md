## 📌 About

**SweetyBread** is a small Minecraft plugin created **purely for fun and Java practice**.

The idea was inspired by the Russian cult film **“Green Elephant” (Зелёный слоник)** and was never meant to be offensive, deep, or meaningful.  
It started as a **spontaneous joke from a friend**, and I decided to implement it just for laughs and to practice writing plugins in Java.

No lore.  
No hidden meaning.  
Just memes and code.
